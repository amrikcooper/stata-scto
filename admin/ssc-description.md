# SSC Meta Description
See instructions for the content in this file here: http://repec.org/bocode/s/sscsubmit.html

This is the information that will show when typing `ssc describe scto` and on the ideas.repec.org page that will be created once we publish the first version. See, as an example, `ssc describe ietoolkit` and https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458137.html.

When updating this information at any point in the future, send the content of the 4 sections (Description, Keywords, Required Stata Version and Author and Email) to Kit Baum when you are updating the package. Just copy the raw text to the body of the email.

If you are not updating this meta information when updating the files in the `scto` package, then you do not have to submit this information with the files.

### Description
The scto Stata package includes a set of utility functions related to data collected using SurveyCTO, www.surveycto.com. Currently the package includes two commands that both use sensor stream data files as input. Sensor stream data are recordings of light level, sound level and pitch, and movement during tablet assisted data collections. These commands take the sensor stream data and aggregate it so it can be merged with the main data, or calculate statistics for each time period throughout the interview. These commands are developed by the team at SurveyCTO.

### What are keywords?
This is an explanation to the keywords used below. I do not know how frequently they are used, but this is a list of keywords that are searchable. So if you search on _field work_ (but I do not know where you do that search) you should find this command as it is one of the keywords.
