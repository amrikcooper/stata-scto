{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:sctostreamcsv} is a command that adds statistics to the sensor stream .csv files outputted by the {it:sensor_stream} field in {browse "https://www.surveycto.com/":SurveyCTO's} data collection tool. The .csv files includes sensor data (light level, sound level, sound pitch and movement) recorded during the interview by the device used in the data collection. The unit of observation (what each row represents) in the outputted .csv files is the time period the sensor data is reported on. The default is one second, but this can be specified in the questionnaire form.{p_end}

{pstd}This command adds one column for each {it:Standardized Statistics} option and/or each {it:Customizable Statistics} option specified by the user.  Each of these statistics are calculated as booleans, i.e. either true or false. For example, was it quiet or not, was the sensor within a certain range or not. This true or false, represented as 1 or 0 where 1 is true, is calculated for each time period for that sensor and then this command calculates the percentage of time periods for which this variable was 1 and report that value in the .dta file. The variable for each statistics in the .dta file therefore represent the percentage of the interview that was quiet, where the sensor was within a certain range, etc., for each submission.{p_end}

{pstd}After calculating the statistics the command generates a new .csv file and save it in the {cmdab:output:folder(}{it:folder_path}{cmd:)} keeping the same name the file had in the {cmdab:media:folder()}. If the file already exist in the output folder, then the file is skipped. So the only way to add new statistics to already generated files is to use the option {cmd:replace}. Note that this overwrites any manual edits made to the files after they were generated by this command.{p_end}

{title:Options}

{pstd}{it:{ul:{hi:Required options:}}}{p_end}
{phang}{cmdab:media:folder(}{it:string}{cmd:)} indicates where the .csv file exported from the SurveyCTO server are saved. This is called the media folder because that is the name of the folder where SurveyCTO Sync saves these files. Other files not relevant to this commands may also be stored in this folder as this command can tell which files are sensor stream files based on the file name.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:output:folder(}{it:string}{cmd:)} indicates where the newly generated csv file will be saved. This folder may not be the same folder as the folder in {cmdab:media:folder()}. The output folder is used to list which files have already been processed and therefore skipped by this command (unless {cmd:replace} is used).{p_end}

{pstd}{it:{ul:{hi:Output options:}}}{p_end}
{phang}{cmdab:keyvar} tells the command to save the uniquely identifying ID generated by the SurveyCTO server in a variable called {it:key} in the new .csv file. The key is always stored in the file name regardless if this option is used or not. This is not the same ID as any ID entered manually by the enumerators in the field. This ID is generated on the server for each submission. The same observation can have multiple submissions if, for example, poor internet connection requires a second attempt to submit a form with all the meta files. The default is to not add this column as it saves disk space and the information is stored in the file name regardless.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:replace} makes the command overwrite any files already in the {cmdab:output:folder()} instead of simply skipping those files. Since this will overwrite the files in the output folder, all manual edits made after the file was originally generated will be lost. Using this option is the only way to update a .csv file already generated by this command.{p_end}

{pstd}{it:{ul:{hi:Standardized Statistics options:}}}{p_end}
{phang}{cmdab:quiet} adds a variable called {it:quiet} to the any SL (sound level) sensor stream .csv file. This variable will be 1 for all time periods for which the mean sound level is less than 25dB. For all other non-missing values this variable will be 0. An error will be generated if this option is used and no SL sensor file exist in the {cmdab:media:folder()} folder.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:still} adds a variable called {it:still} to the any MV (movement) sensor stream .csv file. This variable will be 1 for all time periods for which the mean movement is less than 0.25 m/s^2. For all other non-missing values this variable will be 0. An error will be generated if this option is used and no MV sensor file exist in the {cmdab:media:folder()} folder.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:moving} adds a variable called {it:moving} to the any MV (movement) sensor stream .csv file. This variable will be 1 for all time periods for which the mean movement is greater than 2 m/s^2. For all other non-missing values this variable will be 0. An error will be generated if this option is used and no MV sensor file exist in the {cmdab:media:folder()} folder.{p_end}

{marker customstats}
{pstd}{it:{ul:{hi:Customizable Statistics options:}}}{p_end}

{pstd}All of the following options take a {inp:{it:range_string}} as value. The {it:range_string} is used to indicate the name of the new variable this command should create and for which range this variable should be 1 for each time period. The new variable is 0 for all other non-missing values. Each new variable in the {it:range_string} is specified like this: {inp:{it:varname}({it:min max})}, where {it:varname} is the name of the new variable to be created, and {it:min} and {it:max} are the lower and upper boundaries for the range. Round brackets indicate that the boundary is exclusive, and straight bracket is inclusive. One of min and max can be replaced with a question mark to have a greater-than or less-than expression instead of a range. Multiple new variables can be specified in the same {it:range_string}. See examples below. {p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:llbet:ween(}{it:range_string}{cmd:)} allows the user to manually specified statistics for the light level stream. See documentation on the  {it:range_string} above and examples below. An error will be generated if this option is used and no light level sensor files exist in the {cmdab:media:folder()} folder.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:slbet:ween(}{it:range_string}{cmd:)} allows the user to manually specified statistics for the sound level stream. See documentation on the  {it:range_string} above and examples below. An error will be generated if this option is used and no sound level sensor files exist in the {cmdab:media:folder()} folder.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:spbet:ween(}{it:range_string}{cmd:)} allows the user to manually specified statistics for the sound pitch stream. See documentation on the  {it:range_string} above and examples below. An error will be generated if this option is used and no sound pitch sensor files exist in the {cmdab:media:folder()} folder.{p_end}

{phang}{cmdab:mvbet:ween(}{it:range_string}{cmd:)} allows the user to manually specified statistics for the movement stream. See documentation on the  {it:range_string} above and examples below. An error will be generated if this option is used and no movement sensor file exists in the {cmdab:media:folder()} folder.{p_end}

{pstd}{ul:range_string examples:}{p_end}

{phang}{inp:llbetween(}{it:indoors_lit(100 750)}{inp:)} will create a variable in light level stream files named {it:indoors_lit} that is 1 for each time period where the mean light level was between 100 lux (exclusive) and 750 lux (exclusive).{p_end}

{phang}{inp:slbetween(}{it:quiet(? 25)}{inp:)} will create a variable in sound level stream files named {it:quiet} that is 1 for each time period where the mean sound level was below 25 dB (exclusive). This is identical to the variable created when using option {inp:quiet} {p_end}

{phang}{inp:mvbetween(}{it:mv1[.2 .25) mv2[1 ?]}{inp:)} will create two variables in movement stream files named {it:mv1} and {it:mv2}. {it:mv1} is 1 for each time period where the mean movement is between .2  m/s^2 (inclusive) and .25 m/s^2 (exclusive). {it:mv2} is 1 for each time period where the mean movement is greater than 1 m/s^2 (exclusive).{p_end}

{marker examples}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}All examples will use the following globals as folder paths: {p_end}

{pstd}{inp:global project "}C:\Users/username/Documents/ProjectA{inp:"}{p_end}
{pstd}{inp:global media "}$project/raw_data/media{inp:"}{p_end}
{pstd}{inp:global output "}$project/outputs{inp:"}{p_end}

{pstd} {hi:Example 1.}

{pstd} {inp:sctostreamcsv, mediafolder(}{it:}"$media"{inp:) outputfolder(}{it:"$output"}{inp:) quiet still}

{pstd}This is a very simple way to run the command. The command will read sensor stream .csv files in the media folder with the prefix SL (because {inp:quiet} was used) and the prefix MV (because {inp:still} was used) and add create the {it:quiet} variable in the SL files and the {it:still} variable in the MV files and save the new files in the output folder. If the file already exists in the output folder then it is skipped. Any sensor stream files with prefix SP or LL in the media folder will be ignored as no statistic applicable to either of those streams were specified.

{pstd} {hi:Example 2.}

{pstd} {inp:sctostreamcsv, mediafolder(}{it:}"$media"{inp:) outputfolder(}{it:"$output"}{inp:) quiet slbetween(}{it:loud(60 ?)}{inp:) replace}

{pstd} In this example, the command will only read SL sensor stream .csv files from the media folder as sound level is the only sensor for which statistics are specified. The {it:quiet} and {it:loud} variables will be added to all SL files in the media folder. Any files in the output folder already in the output folder will be overwritten if the corresponding original file is still in the media folder.
